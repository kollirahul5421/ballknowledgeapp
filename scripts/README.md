## Setup Instructions

### 1. Navigate to Scripts Directory
```bash

```

## What the Script Does

1. **Connects to Supabase** using your existing environment variables
2. **Checks for duplicates** before inserting each player
3. **Assigns random teams** from current NBA teams
4. **Generates image URLs** using a mix of NBA CDN format and placeholder images
5. **Provides detailed progress** with colored console output
6. **Handles errors gracefully** and continues processing
7. **Reports final statistics** showing added, skipped, and failed insertions

## Sample Output

```
üèÄ Starting bulk upload of 100 NBA players...

üìä Total processed: 100 players
==================================================

üéâ Your NBA guessing game now has more players to challenge users!
```

## Player Selection Strategy

The script focuses on **obscure players** to make the guessing game more challenging:

- Current NBA bench players
- Recent draft picks
- Role players and specialists
- International players
- G-League call-ups
- Rookie and sophomore players

This avoids superstars like LeBron, Curry, Durant, etc., making the game more interesting for NBA fans.

## Error Handling

- **Duplicate names**: Automatically skipped with warning
- **Network errors**: Logged and script continues
- **Invalid data**: Logged with details
- **Missing environment variables**: Script exits with clear error message

## Customization

You can modify the script to:

- Add your own player list in the `OBSCURE_NBA_PLAYERS` array
- Change team assignments in the `NBA_TEAMS` array
- Modify image URL generation in `generateNBAImageUrl()`
- Adjust the delay between insertions (currently 100ms)

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables"
- Ensure your `.env` file exists in the root directory
- Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set

### "Error inserting player"
- Check your Supabase RLS policies allow public insert
- Verify your database connection
- Ensure the `players` table exists with correct schema

### Script runs but no players added
- Check if all players already exist in your database
- Try running with a higher number: `node bulk-upload-players.js 200`

## Database Schema

The script expects this table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  team text NOT NULL,
  image_url text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

This matches your existing database schema.
